initramfs-tools (0.119) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The initramfs will now run fsck on the root filesystem before
    mounting it.  If the chosen init program is systemd and there is a
    separate /usr filesystem, it will also fsck and mount /usr.
  * If /usr is a separate filesystem on a RAID device and the INITRDSTART
    setting in /etc/default/mdadm is not 'all', you will need to change it
    to include that device.
  * If /usr is a separate filesystem on an LVM logical volume, and the
    line for /usr in /etc/fstab specifies the device by UUID or LABEL,
    you must change this line to specify the device using the format
    /dev/mapper/VG-LV or /dev/VG/LV.
  * It is no longer possible to bind-mount the /usr filesystem.
  * If the RTC (real time clock) is set to local time and the local time is
    ahead of UTC, e2fsck will print a warning during boot about the time
    changing backward (bug #767040).  You can disable this by putting the
    following lines in /etc/e2fsck.conf:
        [options]
        broken_system_clock=1

initramfs-tools (0.94) unstable; urgency=low

    To improve boot speed and avoid some complications, video drivers are
    no longer included in the initramfs by default (MODULES=most).

initramfs-tools (0.76) unstable; urgency=low

    This release features nfs auto detection in the initramfs.
    The boot paramaters are parsed according to the linux source
    Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt and more specifically
    Documentation/nfsroot.txt.

    The initramfs-tools(8) manpage documents the parsed boot parameter.
    Note that the undocumented and non compliant nfsoption bootarg got
    dropped.

initramfs-tools (0.61) unstable; urgency=low

    This release moves the initramfs-tools confdir from /etc/mkinitramfs to
    /etc/initramfs-tools. Packages are encouraged to ship files as scripts
    under /usr/share/initramfs-tools.

    Local tests behaved fine, but be warned that this could potentially
    cause boot troubles on upgrade.

initramfs-tools (0.10) breezy; urgency=low

    This release includes hardware auto detection in the initramfs.
    This means two things in particular that are important:

    1) the resulting initramfs will be huge.  Like 10 megs huge.
       I will shrink it down once it's correct.  If you're on an
       arch that doesn't like >4mb initramfs', then this won't boot.

    2) Your network drivers are loaded in the initramfs, so hotplug
       won't see a network event, so ifup won't be run.  This will
       be fixed shortly in hotplug.
